# EASY ROUTE LLM
Easy Route Llm is one of my  pioneering projects leveraging the power of RouteLLM, an open-source framework designed to optimize the cost and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). By intelligently routing queries between high-performance models like GPT-4 and more cost-effective models like LLaMA 3, this innovative approach achieves up to an 85% reduction in costs while maintaining exceptional response quality. Utilizing Streamlit for its chat interface, Easy Route Llm makes advanced AI technology more accessible and efficient.


## SETUP

**3. Install the required dependencies:**

pip install -r requirements.txt

(**Note:** The project utilizes GPT-4 and LLaMA 3 as the strong and weak models, respectively. You can substitute these with models of your choice. If you opt to use GPT-4, ensure you set your own OpenAI key. Feel free to edit the models in main.py as needed.)

After configuring your preferred LLM models, run the application with:
